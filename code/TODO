 *** WHEN YOU GET TO COMPETITION

Calibration session at 8am on Thursday:
- Camera brightness
- Target color
- Camera mount alignment

Turn down brightness from 20 to 10 percent because there's a lot more light at competition than in WIT
	You'll need to update the percieved color of the target.  With different brightness it will seem like the target is a different color, but the color we're looking for was taken at 20% brightness
		Save a camera picture and put it in paint.  Then use the eyedropper tool
	The setting is in both the visionTarget module and the camera settup.  The camera settup is what matters; don't forget to change both!

Retune PID for pneumatic wheel

Tune vision align pid

Retune the speedAdj value to work with the pneumatic wheels

Test pneumatic ballgate replacement





 *** STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE

Finish PID tuning for vision align on NanoBot




 *** DONE

Fix visionOverlay code
	Asserted identical types for the sent data and recieved data
	the 2 perameter means highlight... this might not be favorable but it sure is visible
	Often you have to move the robot for it to update the picture... can we fix this?

Implement colors in the dbgtrace lib
	Colorize all the errors and status lights and such
	Check how to do colours in bash - assert the validity of the constants

Implement pneumatic ballgate replacement

debug the Console module

Try new PID tuning of pneumatic wheels - higher P, more D
	Can this be automated?
